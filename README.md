# ashley okolio portfolio site

A redesign and development of Ashley Okoli site created with Vanilla JS, [GSAP](https://gsap.com/resources/getting-started), HTML, and CSS.

## Resources used
- [GSAP Animation Library](https://gsap.com/resources/getting-started)
- Some inspiration, as always.

## Future Development
- Possible migration to a frontend framework.
- Addition of pages.

## General Notes
> I made this site because I wanted to create more complicated sites that focused on animations. I didn't finish the site because I wanted to move on to sites that focused on functionality and used libraries to implement that.
